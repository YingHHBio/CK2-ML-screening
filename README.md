# CK2-ML-screening
Machine learning pipeline and processed datasets for screening novel CK2 inhibitors (figure-wise notebooks for reproducibility)
## Repository structure
This repository is organized by manuscript figures.

- `figures/Figure_1D/`  
  Code and data used to generate Figure 1D.
- `figures/supplementary_figure_2/`  
  Code and data for Supplementary Figure 2.
- `figures/supplementary_figure_3/`  
  Code and data for Supplementary Figure 3.
- `figures/supplementary_figure_4/`  
  Code and data for Supplementary Figure 4.

Each folder contains a Jupyter notebook and the corresponding processed datasets.

## Reproducibility
Each figure can be reproduced independently by running the corresponding Jupyter notebook
using the CSV files provided in the same folder.

## Requirements
The notebooks were developed using Python. Key dependencies include:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Data availability
All processed datasets used for machine learning model training and evaluation
are included in this repository.
